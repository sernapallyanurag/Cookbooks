# sonarqube-mysql

Configures a MySQL instance with a database and user for SonarQube. Provides LWRPs for managing sonar configuration held in the MySQL database.

## Notes

- See `test/integration/cookbooks/test` for usage examples
- Ensure the correct SonarQube URL is set in the attributes
  - The LWRPs will use this to check the status of the server before trying to update any database tables
- Does not install SonarQube in case there are specific needs on your system
  - add `sonarqube::default` to your run list after `sonarqube-mysql::default` for a simple installation
    - remember to override the JDBC connection attributes to point to your MySQL database
  - it is necesarry to install and run SonarQube before calling the LWRPs as this populates the initial state of the database
- Does not install MySQL in case there are specific needs on your system
  - add `mysql::server` to your run list before `sonarqube-mysql::default` for a simple installation
- Does not run `apt::default` on Ubuntu
  - add `apt::default` to your run list before anything else if you're deploying on Ubuntu
